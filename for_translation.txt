Turing AI Onboarding 
<<</p1_b0>>>

<<<p1_b1>>>
Microsoft has 2 flavours of CoPilot – Consumer and Enterprise. Consumer is for individual 
customers and Enterprise is for Enterprises. These two flavours are powered by independent 
systems. Enterprise CoPilot (aka m365) has notion of 2 tabs – Work and Web. When a user is in 
Work tab, CoPilot can access enterprise data (like documents, emails, Teams messages, SharePoint 
sites, etc). In Web tab, it cannot access Enterprise data. Enterprise CoPilot ensures that we are 
handling the Enterprise customers data (like queries they are asking, logging, etc) are handled in a 
compliant manner, and we cannot access customer queries (i.e. eyes-off data), identifying logs, etc. 
Consumer CoPilot doesn’t have these restrictions.  
<<</p1_b1>>>

<<<p1_b2>>>
Consumer CoPilot is owned by MAI (Microsoft AI). Enterprise CoPilot is owned by the org called 
MSAI (Microsoft Search, Assistant and Intelligence). Turing AI is part of this larger org and owns Web 
tab. Turing AI org charter is to bring innovative (frontier) features/work to the platform, as well ensure 
that the quality of existing features is at least at par with our main competitors like ChatGPT. 
<<</p1_b2>>>

<<<p1_b3>>>
Enterprise CoPilot is served by a backend platform called Sydney. It is a C# based service with huge 
amount of code base. The platform serves both Web and Work tab on M365, as well calls coming 
from other Office products/Edge Side bar/etc. The frontend is written in ReactJS and the code base is 
generally referred to as 1JS. The Enterprise CoPilot platform has several other components/tools, etc 
– for example  
<<</p1_b3>>>

<<<p1_b4>>>
1. SEVAL which is an evaluation framework for CoPilot. This manages curated datasets which are 
used to evaluate the model performance for new releases.  
<<</p1_b4>>>

<<<p1_b5>>>
2. CoPilot Playground: A tool (web portal) which allows you to send inputs to your chosen LLM 
directly, and you can examine what the LLM outputs.  
<<</p1_b5>>>

<<<p1_b6>>>
3. DevUI: This is a UI built purposefully to help examine your query sent to CoPilot, and how it 
orchestrated the execution of the query.  
<<</p1_b6>>>

<<<p1_b7>>>
4. Kusto: CoPilot instrumentation/metrics/logs data are stored in Kusto clusters, and we can query 
them  
<<</p1_b7>>>

<<<p1_b8>>>
5. CoPilot Dash: A tool (web portal) which allows us to analyse customer thumbs down/thumbs up 
details.   
<<</p1_b8>>>

<<<p1_b9>>>
Initially Sydney was serving both Consumer and Enterprise. Then Consumer was decoupled from it 
totally. Also there was a fork for Web and Work, and now Web and Work are totally served by the 
same system Sydney. While going through the documents/videos/code, ignore references to 
sydcomp, and Avalon. Everything for Enterprise CoPilot is now a single code base and branch 
(master). Also depending on the context in which it gets used, BizChat can mean Enterprise CoPilot 
and sometimes Work Tab alone. CWC (Compliant Web Chat) is synonymous to Web tab.  
<<</p1_b9>>>

<<<p1_b10>>>
Commented [AS1]: Need not get into history for a new 
joinee of consumer copilot 
<<</p1_b10>>>

<<<p1_b11>>>
Commented [AP2R1]: I added because it was among 
the most confusing items for me to grasp. The references 
of past keep coming in.  
<<</p1_b11>>>

<<<p1_b12>>>
How does Sydney work at the core level (or for that matter any LLM works): LLMs are very 
powerful. But they are trained on the data that was available at the time of training. So, if we pass the 
user query directly to LLM (along with suitable prompt), it will just return an answer from it’s own 
knowledge. To extend the knowledge and capabilities of an LLM model, we can pass specification for 
additional capabilities to the model (like search_web, schedule_task, etc). Looking at the query, LLM 
may decide to invoke such capabilities also called as tools or plugins). For example, in case user 
asks “Can you share the latest market updates every weekday at 9AM”, and we have provided 
specification of a tool called schedule_task while making call to LLM, LLM may respond by requesting 
to invoke schedule_task tool. Now the orchestrator can analyse the response of the model and invoke 
a code which actually schedules a task in the backend systems. Similarly, there can be tools to fetch 
data from web, emails, etc. The tool implementation will fetch the data and provide the data back to 
<<</p1_b12>>>

<<<p1_b13>>>
Commented [AS3R1]: Fair. In your case it was more 
pronounced because I shared the pre-reorg onboarding 
links (lazily).  
<<</p1_b13>>>

# --- Page 2 ---

<<<p2_b0>>>
the LLM. Now the system can again make a LLM call with the result of tool call, and LLM may decide 
to invoke more tools, or may simply tell us that it has all the data available to respond to user (by 
invoking a special tool say generate_response). Now the final call to LLM will generate the response 
to the user.  
<<</p2_b0>>>

<<<p2_b1>>>
In nutshell, this is how the core of the Sydney orchestrator (known as Flux V3) works to serve a user 
query (obviously it is very simplified version):  
<<</p2_b1>>>

<<<p2_b2>>>
user_query = “” //get user query 
<<</p2_b2>>>

<<<p2_b3>>>
LLMRequest llm_request; //construct request to LLM be combining user query, reasoning LLM prompt, and other context 
<<</p2_b3>>>

<<<p2_b4>>>
while (true) { 
<<</p2_b4>>>

<<<p2_b5>>>
llm_response = callLLM(llm_request); 
<<</p2_b5>>>

<<<p2_b6>>>
if llm_response has tool calls { 
<<</p2_b6>>>

<<<p2_b7>>>
 
if the tool call is generate_response { 
<<</p2_b7>>>

<<<p2_b8>>>
combine user query, all previous tool calls and their results to construct llm_request. leverage 
prompt for responding/synthesis 
<<</p2_b8>>>

<<<p2_b9>>>
 
 
llm_response = callLLM(llm_request); 
<<</p2_b9>>>

<<<p2_b10>>>
 
 
return response to user 
<<</p2_b10>>>

<<<p2_b11>>>
} 
<<</p2_b11>>>

<<<p2_b12>>>
else { 
<<</p2_b12>>>

<<<p2_b13>>>
 
call all the tools mentioned in the response and collect results 
<<</p2_b13>>>

<<<p2_b14>>>
 
combine user query, all previous tool calls and their results to construct llm_request 
<<</p2_b14>>>

<<<p2_b15>>>
} 
<<</p2_b15>>>

Onboarding Steps to follow 
<<</p5_b7>>>

<<<p5_b8>>>
One of the most important step to perform (once your laptop is setup), is to request for CompliantSydney access 
via Pulse and Enterprise Sydney Team Contributors (important to get access to WIKIS) via Myaccess Portal . This 
will allow you to access Sydney related Wikis/Code bases, etc.  
 
How to request for CompliantSydney access: 
Go to: Identity - M365 Pulse 
Search for CompliantSydney in Operational Eligibilites, Click on CompliantSydney, and Submit Request. You will 
need to complete the pre-requisites (Required Clearances) before you can request. Complete those pre-requsites.  
<<</p5_b8>>>

# --- Page 6 ---

<<<p6_b0>>>
 
Once clearences are done, raise the ComplientSydney request again. 
 
How to request for Enterprise Sydney Team Contributors: 
Go to: My Access Portal 
Search for “Enterprise Sydney Team Contributors” access package. 
Submit your request. You’ll need to have completed required training (Security Foundations, Privacy 
Fundamentals) and your manager’s approval may be required. Post your manager’s approval, there would be one 
more approval required which might take 1-2 days. 
 
In case of any question (whatever it could be), always try searching for it in CoPilot Work Tab 
Request for permissions listed in Dev Onboarding (you may be able to access this only once you have acquired 
CompliantSydney access) : Developer-Onboarding | M365 Chat Platform (aka compliant-sydney) 
Setup your dev box (aka remote dev machine assigned to you). Go to Microsoft Dev Box and create a new dev box. 
BasicDevBox with 1ESBasicDevBoxWeekly image should be Ok. Chose region as Central India. Let the dev box get 
created. Use Virtual DevBox Onboarding (VDB) - Overview to download Remote Desktop Software to connect to 
the Dev Box 
Use Running the Setup Script | M365 Chat Platform (aka compliant-sydney) to run Sydney Locally. Download code 
at root drive (say Q:\Sydney as lately there are some large file names which do not get cloned and causes 
problems). With this, Sydney will run locally and it will launch Dev Box Ui which you can use to interact with 
Sydney. In case of any troubleshooting, search for issue in Teams – most likely others would have faced the similar 
issue in the past. In case it takes more than 1-2 hours to run Sydney locally, reach out to existing team members.  
Bookmark Sydney Wiki: Engineering Hub (I guess this is also another wiki: Wiki - Overview) and Sydney Repo: 
Sydney - Repos . Explore Wiki, introduction videos, and basic rampup docs on LLMs, etc 
Get familiar with ways of doing Prompt iterations: Experimenting with Prompt & Tool Changes in FluxV3 - 
Overview This will need DevUI setup (Dev UI - Overview)  
 
By this time, your setup should include a DevBox, your laptop or DevBox running Git, Visual studio, WSL (if 
comfortable with Linux), running Sydney locally, and be able to try out prompt changes & see them 
through DevUI.
